# Invariable Paintings Assets

This pack provides item models and textures for every vanilla painting variants.

This is primarily intended to be used by vanilla clients playing on servers with  **[Invariable Paintings](https://modrinth.com/mod/invariable-paintings)** installed. (Although it may also work with other server-side mods or datapack that sets the `item_model` component of painting items.)

Alternatively, it will also work fully client-side using the mod **[Variants-CIT](https://modrinth.com/mod/variants-cit)**, which provides a few other functionalities:
If a modded painting does not have an item model, it will use a generic one instead of the missing model.
Also, painting items containing invalid variants will use another special texture, (e.g: modded paintings that have been uninstalled, painting items summoned by a command with a typo in it).
